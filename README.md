# üéØ Weekend Activity Planner

> An intelligent AI-powered weekend activity planning system that creates personalized itineraries based on location, preferences, and real-time weather conditions using advanced LangGraph workflows and Google's Gemini AI.

## üöÄ Overview

The Weekend Activity Planner is a sophisticated AI agent built with **LangGraph** that demonstrates advanced workflow orchestration and multi-agent system design. The application intelligently combines user preferences, location data, and weather forecasting to generate comprehensive weekend activity plans through a structured decision-making process.

### Key Technical Achievements

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Implemented using LangGraph's StateGraph for complex workflow management
- **AI Integration**: Leverages Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model for intelligent content generation
- **State Management**: Sophisticated state handling with TypedDict annotations for type safety
- **Prompt Engineering**: Advanced prompt templates for context-aware AI responses
- **Workflow Visualization**: Integrated Mermaid diagram generation for process visualization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

    A[User Input] --> B[Location Collection]
    B --> C[Preferences Gathering]
    C --> D[Weather Analysis]
    D --> E[Plan Generation]
    E --> F[Structured Output]
```

The system follows a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** pattern with four distinct processing nodes:

1. **Location Input Node**: Captures and validates user location data
2. **Preferences Collection Node**: Processes user activity preferences with intelligent parsing
3. **Weather Analysis Node**: Integrates AI-powered weather forecasting
4. **Plan Generation Node**: Synthesizes all inputs into comprehensive weekend itineraries
